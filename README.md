# Solartable
Project that will utilize a solar panel and some aluminium profiles as an outdoor / garden table

## Partlist / BoM

I used several parts to build this table. In this project i will utilize aluminium extrusion profiles, which were also widely known in industry usages (CNC, Robotics, 3D-Printers or any other manufacturing process)
This is the partlist including the shop where I bought them.
I do not get any kind of bonus, in some cases I used spare or used parts, so I will link the manufacturer page.

\* I used this module:  <ins>ASWS Strong Style 390-MH120-N 390 Watt</ins>, at the time of purchase, I paid arount **250 â‚¬** including VAT (19%) in Germany. There is no need to use a bifacial module, you can definitely go for a cheaper one instead. I think this is more beatiful.

\** I purchased a used module on "[eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de)" / classifieds for arround **115 â‚¬**
 
\*** There might be other vendors of aluminium profiles, thus I don't want to cut them on my own. Advantage of a shop like "[myaluprofil.de](https://www.myaluprofil.de)" is that they offer accessories for the aluminum profiles aswell.
