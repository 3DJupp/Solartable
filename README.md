# Solartable
Project that will utilize a solar panel and some aluminium profiles as an outdoor / garden table

## Preface
For a long time i wanted to have a small photovoltaic system to reduce energy costs and produce a portion of my household electricity on my own. There have been and are a lot of regulations in Germany. Thus there is an european law that should permit the installation of small solar panels and microinverters there are still a lot of more or less useful regulations. A table is a comined way of having a hassle free "balcony power station"
So at some point, my local public utilities company changed their laws and switched my electricity meter to a bidirectional one. I have still not heard anything by the landlord, but as a permit for a table is not required i was able to start the project.

## Build process
So, at some day i was finally able to pick up the modules at a local Solar Systems builder. I choosed the panel "ASWS Strong Style 390-MH120-N 390 Watt" and had a look in the [datasheet](https://shop.erene.de/media/14/16/0c/1679044263/datenblatt-ASWS-390-MH120N-BG-deutsch.pdf) for the dimensions. At first i wanted to build that table utilizing wood, but for some reason i thought black aluminium profiles are more durable.
So i wrote down the numbers and calculated how many aluminium bars were required.
I came down to this Bill of materials (Prices as of March 2023) at the shop "myaluprofil":


|Count|Article|Article-Nr.|Price per unit|Total|Length|
|-----|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-------|-------|
|8 x|Winkelsatz 30x30 schwarz Nut 6 I-Typ|H206WS30S 3,20 EUR|25,60 EUR||
|4 x|Kreuz-Kabelbinderblock Nut 6 I-Raster PA|H206KKBPA 0,95 EUR|3,80 EUR||
|4 x|Winkelsatz 30x60 ZN Nut 6 I-Typ|H206WS60 5,80 EUR|23,20 EUR||
|4 x|Winkelsatz 30x30 ZN Nut 6 I-Typ|H206WS30 3,30 EUR|13,20 EUR||
|4 x|Nutenstein mit Steg Nut 6 I-Typ M6|H206NSMS6 0,35 EUR|1,40 EUR||
|4 x|Aluminiumprofil 30x30 Nut 6 I-Typ Leicht 1N Schwarz|H1063030L1NSCH|12,25 EUR|49,00 EUR|**700 mm**|
|2 x|Aluminiumprofil 30x30 Nut 6 I-Typ Leicht 2N90 Schwarz|H1063030L2N90SCH|16,40 EUR|32,80 EUR|**~~978~~ 975 mm**|
|1 x|Aluminiumprofil 30x60 Nut 6 I-Typ Schwarz|H1066030LSCH|30,06 EUR|30,06 EUR|**1400 mm**|

**Edit:** turns out i made a small mistake and the supporting bars (H1063030L2N90SCH)  were a bit too long, so i would suggest to order it in a length of 975 millimeters instead. (not too bad, but worth mentioning)

## Partlist / BoM
I used several parts to build this table. In this project i will utilize aluminium extrusion profiles, which were also widely known in industry usages (CNC, Robotics, 3D-Printers or any other manufacturing process)
This is the partlist including the shop where I bought them.
I do not get any kind of bonus, in some cases I used spare or used parts, so I will link the manufacturer page.

|Part|Further information or shop|Price in Euro (â‚¬)|
|----|---------------------------|-----------------|
|Solar Panel|[ASWS strong style](https://www.asws-solar.de/solarmodule/strong-style)            |150-250 â‚¬*|
|Hoymiles Microinverter|[HM 400 Specs](https://www.hoymiles.com/product/microinverter/hm-300-350-400-eu)|120 â‚¬**|
|Aluminium profiles and accessories|[myaluprofil.de](https://www.myaluprofil.de/Aluminiumprofile)|200 â‚¬***|

\* I used this module:  <ins>ASWS Strong Style 390-MH120-N 390 Watt</ins>, at the time of purchase, I paid arount **250 â‚¬** including VAT (19%) in Germany. There is no need to use a bifacial module, you can definitely go for a cheaper one instead. I think this is more beatiful.

\** I purchased a used module on "[eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de)" / classifieds for arround **115 â‚¬**
 
\*** There might be other vendors of aluminium profiles, thus I don't want to cut them on my own. Advantage of a shop like "[myaluprofil.de](https://www.myaluprofil.de)" is that they offer accessories for the aluminum profiles aswell. A detailed BoM can be found in the build-section.
